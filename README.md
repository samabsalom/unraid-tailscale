# unraid-tailscale

This is based on https://github.com/dmacias72/unRAID-NerdPack

it should need only running once and it should survive updates
it should update if you re run the script

once run you may need to restart your server due to the fact the go script runs at system start 
another alternative would be to use userscripts and set to run in the background
